#W3C DOMCORE Errors#

Provides the **DOMException** and **DOMError** W3C interfaces from the section 3 (Errors) of the **DOM4** akka **DOMCore** W3C Working Draft. These interfaces are also defined in the **WHATWG** HTML5 Living standard.

These interfaces are useful if you want to provide standard Errors in your own APIs or in Polyfill libraries

##How to use##


```javascript
var DOMException = require('w3c-domcore-errors').DOMException;
var InvalidCharacterError = new DOMException('InvalidCharacterError');

function myStringHandler(data) {
    if (!REGEX_VALID_STRING.test(data)) {
        throw InvalidCharacterError;
    }
    // do the job
}
```

##Browser support.. Can I Use...##

If Browsers implement DOMException, **DOMError is most of the time not implemented**.
I plan adapt this Polyfill to enhance Browser DOMError support, more specifically to provide DOMError as a constructor, as defined in the WHATWG edition of the specification.

I posted a feature request on **caniuse.com** to detect potential future implementations, so feel free to support it: http://www.google.com/moderator/#8/e=ae425&q=ae425.6c295c&v=4
